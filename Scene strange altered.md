Vale threw himself to the ground with a jolt, barely noticing the gravel surface tear the flesh from his palms. *Did it see me,* he thought. He didn't dare check. He could hear shuffling coming from a few feet away, like someone was kicking their feet into the dirt out of boredom.

Vale focused on his hearing, trying to discern which direction the sounds was heading. It seemed to be moving... away from him? Maybe towards him, he wasn't sure. Stench filled his nostrils, rot and death swelling inside his lungs. He held his breath, his heartbeat pounding in his ears, his higher thoughts drowning below a sea of fear. He lost track of how much time passed as he lay in the dirt, bits of which had made its way under his eyelids, making them burn.

He knew he would have to get up eventually, to face whatever it was blocking his path. If it was even still there. He didn't hear any shuffling, just the whistle of a slight breeze rushing past him. It left, Vale knew it. He knew from the stories, the Altered were too dumb to stay in one place, let alone do it without making a noise. *Time to get up and go home,*  he thought, *nothing to be afraid of.*

He pushed himself to his knees, then crouched on his feet. He peeked over the haphazardly stacked pile of debris in front of him, trying to get his eyes to focus in the dim moonlight. He reached up with his left arm, wiping away the blur leftover from prolonged exposure to the back of his eyelids.

He blinked hard. It was standing 10 feet in front of him, and it was staring right at him.

The thing was dressed in ripped clothing, revealing unnaturally pale and brittle skin. Muscles bulged and swelled, forming an unnatural weight that bolted its form to the ground. They were so overdeveloped that parts of the altered were unrecognizable, distinctly inhuman, like someone created it by closing their eyes and tossing together a bunch of random parts.

Its brick-wall form cracked as Vale met its gaze. A pair of cloudy black-holes each surrounded by red veins stared back. And in that stare was stored a message. One that Vale intercepted far too often. It was so clear, Vale could thought he could almost hear it. Help me.  *Help me.*

*HELP ME.*

Wait... had he actually just heard it? His mind had to be playing tricks on him.

Rapid footsteps interrupted Vale's train of thought. He pulled his gaze away in time to see a smaller altered charging at him, only about 10 feet away. It wasn't smiling.

*Where did this one come from?* he thought. *Did they just... bait me into a trap?* 

It lunged, outstretched arms ending in long, razor sharp claws. Vale tried to step away, but in his shaking panic his foot slipped, causing him to fall back. The second altered sailed through the space his body just occupied.

Vale scrambled to his feet, upturned dirt and dust obscuring his vision and drying his throat. He turned to run. He only made it a few steps before an unseen force tackled him to the ground. A sudden pain rushed into his left shoulder, accompanied by a tearing sensation as the creature ripped its claw from his back. Cries of excitement from behind him served as a backdrop for the pain that quickly overwhelmed Vale's senses. He tried to scream but the air in his lungs had already abandoned him.

He pushed against the ground, trying to get his feet under him, but the altered casually shoved him back to the ground. It let out another maniacle chuckle. Vale stayed there, paralyzed on the ground, waiting for it all to end. He was pretty sure he could still move his body, and in fact, he was mostly uninjured, apart from the wound on his back. 

That's not why he remained unmoved. This creature had not commanded Vale to stop fighting, nor did it inject anything into his veins. No, Vale chose to lay down and cower in the dirt. He chose to let this thing end him. Worst of all, he chose to stop fighting, to give up. 

So he laid there and waited to be killed for what felt like eternity.

*Shoudn't I be dead? That thing didn't look like it was trying to take its time. Maybe I am dead and the afterlife is just what you experienced right before you died. Or maybe the afterlife was you experiencing your death over*
