Vale threw himself to the ground with a jolt, barely noticing the gravel surface tear the flesh from his palms. *Did it see me,* he thought. He didn't dare check. He could hear shuffling coming from a few feet away, like someone was kicking their feet into the dirt out of boredom.

Vale focused on his hearing, trying to discern which direction the sounds was heading. It seemed to be moving... away from him? Maybe towards him, he wasn't sure. Stench filled his nostrils, rot and death swelling inside his lungs. He held his breath, his heartbeat pounding in his ears, his higher thoughts drowning below a sea of fear. He lost track of how much time passed as he lay in the dirt, bits of which had made its way under his eyelids, making them burn.

He knew he would have to get up eventually, to face whatever it was blocking his path. If it was even still there. He didn't hear any shuffling, just the whistle of a slight breeze rushing past him.
