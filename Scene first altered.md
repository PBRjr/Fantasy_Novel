He held his breath, his heartbeat pounding in his ears, his higher thoughts drowning below a sea of fear. He lost track of how much time passed as he lay in the dirt, his eyes squeezed shut, the smell of mud and stone overwhelming his senses.

He knew he would have to get up eventually, to face whatever it was blocking his path. If it was even still there.
