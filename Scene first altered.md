Vale threw himself to the ground with a jolt, barely noticing the gravel surface tear the flesh from his palms. *Did it see me,* he thought. He didn't dare check. He could hear shuffling coming from a few feet away, like someone was kicking their feet into the dirt out of boredom.

Vale focused on his hearing, trying to discern which direction the sounds was heading. It seemed to be moving... away from him? Maybe towards him, he wasn't sure. He held his breath, his heartbeat pounding in his ears, his higher thoughts drowning below a sea of fear. He lost track of how much time passed as he lay in the dirt, his eyes squeezed shut, the smell of mud and stone overwhelming his senses.

He knew he would have to get up eventually, to face whatever it was blocking his path. If it was even still there. He didn't hear any shuffling, just the whistle of a slight breeze rushing past him. It left, Vale knew it. He knew from the stories, the Altered were too dumb to stay in one place, let alone do it without making a noise. *Time to get up and go home,* he thought, *nothing to be afraid of.*

He pushed himself to his knees, then crouched on his feet. He peeked over the haphazardly stacked pile of debris in front of him, trying to get his eyes to focus in the dim moonlight. He reached up with his left arm, wiping away the blur leftover from prolonged exposure to the back of his eyelids.

He blinked hard. It was standing 10 feet in front of him. It was staring right at him. And it **smiled**.
