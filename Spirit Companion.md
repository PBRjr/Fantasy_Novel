The protagonist comes into contact with a "spirit companion"?

He is forced to journey with the thing, which leads to an exploration of the human condition, and a hard fought one at that.

### Helping Points
1. **Creating the Non-Human Character:** Think about what kind of creature or entity this character is. Are they a magical creature from local folklore, a spirit bound to the land, or something entirely new? Their nature can greatly influence their perspective and how they interact with the world and the protagonist.
    
2. **Language and Communication:** Consider how this non-human character communicates. Do they speak a common language, or do they have a unique way of communicating, such as through thoughts, emotions, or images? This can add an interesting layer to their interactions and provide a way to explore non-verbal communication and understanding.
    
3. **Cultural Exchange:** As your protagonist explains human concepts like empathy or compassion, they also learn from the non-human character. This exchange can be a source of conflict, humor, and growth. The non-human character may have a very different perspective on life, nature, and magic, offering fresh insights to both the protagonist and the reader.
    
4. **Developing a Bond:** The relationship between the protagonist and their non-human companion should evolve over the story. Initially, there might be mistrust or misunderstanding, but as they journey together, a deep bond forms. This relationship can be a significant source of emotional depth and character development.
    
5. **Contrasting Worldviews:** Use the non-human character's worldview to contrast with human society. This can highlight the peculiarities of human behavior and society, and allow for commentary on various aspects of human culture and morality.
    
6. **Role in the Plot:** This character can have a crucial role in the plot, perhaps guiding the protagonist to important locations, offering wisdom or knowledge about the magic system, or even saving the protagonist in dire situations.
    
7. **Moral and Ethical Dilemmas:** The non-human character's presence can lead to moral and ethical dilemmas for the protagonist, especially if their species or nature is misunderstood or feared by society. This can add tension and complexity to the story, as the protagonist must navigate these challenges.
    
8. **Teaching and Learning Moments:** The non-human character can serve as a teacher or mentor in magical matters, while the protagonist teaches them about humanity. This mutual learning can be a source of growth for both characters.
